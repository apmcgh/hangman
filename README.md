# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Lessons learnt
Discovered the assignement expression `:=`.

# Installation instructions
Pre-requisites:
- Python, conda, git must be installed, configured and working.
- I assume you have basic knowledge of the above.

Installation:

- `conda create -n <<env name>>`

Note: for a start conda is not really useful as I use the default python version and only standard libraries. But in future we may need it.

    conda activate <<env name>>
